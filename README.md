## Motivation 🌱
In response to the growing emphasis on sustainability, SolarSync focuses on the key concerns in EV production, including energy sources and infrastructure. Traditional EV charging often relies on non-renewable grid energy, which can hinder the eco-friendliness of EVs. Elon Musk's projection in July 2023 highlights a potential tripling of U.S. electricity consumption due to battery-powered vehicles by 2045. This surge could strain the U.S. power grid. Furthermore, existing EV charging applications lack essential features. They lack connectivity to a reliable network of verified EV chargers, struggle with locating convenient and dependable charging stations, and lack a user-friendly and intuitive platform.

## Solution 💡
SolarSync tackles these challenges by incentivizing EV drivers to connect with renewable energy-powered charging stations. A point system rewards drivers with solar credits for each charge at a solar-powered station. Home charger owners with solar panels can earn solar credits by lending out their chargers for bookings. These credits can then be utilized for personal charging needs.
