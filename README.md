## Motivation
With the growing emphasis on sustainability, the main pillars of concern in EV production, such as energy source and infrastructure, are at the forefront. Traditional EV charging often relies on non-renewable grid energy, which can hinder the overall eco-friendliness of EVs. As highlighted by Elon Musk in July 2023, the U.S. is expected to see a significant surge in electricity consumption due to battery-powered vehicles, potentially tripling by 2045. This EV boom has the potential to strain the U.S. power grid. Additionally, current EV charging applications fall short in several areas. There's a lack of connectivity with a trusted network of verified EV chargers, difficulties in finding convenient and reliable charging stations, and a need for a more user-friendly and intuitive platform. 

## Solution
SolarSync solves the above problem by encouraging EV drivers to connect with charging stations powered by renewable energy. This will be incentivised through a point system, where drivers earn solar credits every time they charge at a solar-powered station. Drivers with solar panels will be incentivised to loan their home chargers out by earning solar credits every time they receive a booking. Drivers can then use these credits towards their own charging.

## How is SolarSync developed?
- Front-end: React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS
- Back-end: Firebase, Vercel, and SmartCar API
